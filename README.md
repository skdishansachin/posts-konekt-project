## Konekt Project Assessment

The `main` branch contains the code I submitted **before the deadline.** The `improved-code` branch contains the refactored code, which I worked on after the deadline and kept **unmerged**. Other branches, apart from `main` and `improved-code`, are mostly sub-branches for fixes and feature updates and can be ignored.
